# Bin Packing Project

This project implements a 3D bin packing algorithm to allocate products in packages, taking into account both the weight and dimensions of both. The project was created using Node.js, Nest.js, and TypeScript.

## Requirements

- Node.js
- NPM or Yarn (package managers)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/andre-fig/bin-packing.git
```

2. Enter the project directory:

```sh
cd bin-packing
```

3. Install the dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

## Execution

To run the project, use the following command:

```sh
npm run start
```

The application will start on port 3000. Open the browser and access http://localhost:3000/bin-packing to see the allocation of products in packages based on the 3D bin packing algorithm.
